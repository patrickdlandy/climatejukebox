## About

Climate Jukebox is a database of musical references to climate change that includes information about musical artists, albums, songs, genres, and climate-specific lyrical or other musical themes. This database is intended to be a public resource that tracks the development of climate-influenced music over time, as an artistic reflection of the developing climate crisis.

## Resources

A downloadable CSV of the most recent Climate Jukebox dataset is available [here](./data/climatejukebox_latest.csv).

## Implementation

Climate Jukebox is a web application written using the following stack and notable libraries/tools:

- React.js
- Redux
- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- MUI Components
- SASS

## Feedback

I maintain this website as a public good.  I am always looking for technical feedback on the website, suggestions for music to include in the database, and proposed edits to information that may be incorrect or incomplete. You can reach out to me using this public repository or email me at climatejukebox@protonmail.com.

If you would like to support this project, please share the website, retweet, follow on spotify, send feedback, or write a song about climate change and tell me about it :)
