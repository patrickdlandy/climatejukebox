The song only has a chorus: \"Save our souls / they'll be lost forever / Trees of green / they'll be gone forever.\" Lyrics verified in personal correspondence. ",

            "notes": "The Yeah Yeah Yeahs' song \"Spitting Off the Edge of the World\" featuring Perfume Genius is included in the database for multiple implicit references to climate change in the lyrics, album art, and music video, as well as confirmation directly from songwriter Karen O. that the song was inspired by the climate crisis. Karen O. is quoted in multiple media outlets, including Rolling Stone and Paste, tying the inspiration for the song to the ongoing climate crisis: \"We’re all experiencing this climate crisis through a system which is broken and not really addressing it... I see the younger generations staring down the threat, and they’re standing on the edge of a precipice, confronting what’s coming with anger and defiance\" (Rolling Stone, Paste). The album cover depicts a woman holding a purse flying through the air upside down, and flames and smoke can be seen on the lower edge of the image, possibly referencing forest fires. The song lyrics offer the listener a foreboding reflection on facing a crisis, with a specific reference to the sun: \"We're spitting off the edge of the world (out in the night) / Never had no chance (nowhere to hide) / Spitting off the edge of the world (out comes the sun) / Never had no chance (nowhere to run)\" (Genius Lyrics). In the song's music video, Karen O. can be seen standing on top of an enormous gas-guzzling limousine decorated with spikes as if for battle with featured artist Perfume Genius in the driver's seat (YouTube).",

It is well established that reductions in sea ice caused by climate change are affecting polar bear populations (Global Change Biology). To further connect the song to global warming, DiFranco also sings \"And it's so god-awful hot outside\" as the next lyric (Genius Lyrics).",

The group has also explicitly discussed in interviews how \"VISION\" and the mini-album it appears on, \"Apocalypse: Follow Us,\" tell a story about resisting climate change. In a 2022 interview with Bandwagon, band leader JiU explained that \"In this mini-album, we talk about heading towards the same direction as one to ﬁght against climate change. We want to show that we can achieve anything if we put our hearts and minds into it!\" (bandwagon.asia). In the lyrics for \"VISION,\" the group sings about banding together as soldiers fighting a battle in the setting of a broken world specifically affected by droughts: \"In this place drier than the desert / This unquenchable thirst / Above the cracks of Earth / Raise your flag and stand your ground / I can't take it, I can't hide any longer / Forward march\" (Genius lyrics English translation). In the music video, the members of Dreamcatcher dance in military uniforms in front of a post-apocalyptic urban background, furthering the war imagery motif (YouTube). ",

            "work_title": "World On Fire",
            "notes": "\"World On Fire\" by Dolly Parton is included in the database for a very strong implicit reference to climate change, despite the singer's choice not to explicitly mention the issue in the song's lyrics or in interviews about the song. The song directly takes aim at politicians and political division as a theme: \"Don't get me started on politics / Now how are we to live in a world like this? / Greedy politicians, present and past / They wouldn't know the truth if it bit 'em in the ass\" (Genius Lyrics). In interviews about the song, this is the theme that she generally chooses to discuss, as she did in an interview with TODAY's Jacob Soboroff that aired May 15 (today.com). Parton's career-long tendency not to align herself too strongly one way or the other on political issues, including the climate, is discussed in depth in climate news website Grist's analysis of the song, which does not draw a conclusion about whether or not the song was intended to be about climate change (Grist). However, despite this (likely intentional) ambiguity, the song contains multiple lyrics that are very hard to imagine outside of the context of a warming world in 2023 following several consecutive years of record-breaking wildfire disasters and decades of climate denial by US politicians: \"Liar, liar, the world's on fire / What you gonna do when it all burns down? / Fire, fire, burnin' higher / Still got time to turn it all around\" (Genius Lyrics). The idea that there is \"still time to turn it all around,\" in particular, calls to mind the time-sensitive task of lowering greenhouse gas emissions to prevent the worst possible impacts of climate change. Lying politicians (climate deniers), a world on fire (a warming world, or literally, a world full of climate-change accelerated wildfires), a call to action (\"turn it all around\"), imagery of protesting (\"Janie got a sign to carry in the fight / Marchin' in the streets with sticks and stones), and album art featuring Parton sitting on a globe going up in flames, together form one of the most powerful implicit references to the climate crisis in the entire database. Parton may have intentionally created this message for those who choose to see it, but even if she did not, this song offers the public an obvious and compelling choice for a potential climate anthem.\n",

            "notes": "\"Global Warming Christmas (There Is No Snow In Kalamazoo)\" is a Christmas single recorded by country musician Sherwin Linton. The song appears to lament the effects of global warming on Santa Claus' appearance and North Pole operations, and it contains numerous expressions of skepticism about the role of regulations in combating global warming. It also notably references the 2006 climate change documentary An Inconvenient Truth. Lyric snippet: \"A letter addressed to Santa Claus / Said he just might be part of the cause / The EPA won't let him be / They're crackin' down at his factory / It's time he thinks about goin' green / Or the government will intervene / Seems makin' all those toys each year / Is having an effect on the atmosphere / Having an effect on the atmosphere / There is no snow in Kalamazoo / It's melting at the North Pole too / Blame it on the CO2 / Cause there is no snow in Kalamazoo / Son Dasher and Dancer and all the rest / Will have to take an emissions test / They better pass without a Poot / They'll be grounded if they pollute / They'll be grounded if they pollute / Now Santa's talkin' retirement / With all this stress on the environment / but how can he tell little Tommy and Ruth / About an inconvenient truth / About an inconvenient truth\" (discogs).",

The song mentions melting glaciers, the effect of melting sea ice on polar bears, carbon emissions, global warming, and rising sea levels. Lyric snippet: \"you melt the polar-knitted ice caps from off of my head / and now I’m drenched to the bone / your lips are global warming / and I’m a glacier melting / as I stand here to the north of you / you’ve got the scientists stumped / there’s not much that can be done / so I’ll wait for the day when all this is through / I saw a polar bear without a patch of ice / to call his own thanks to you / you’ve got me dizzy, spinning circles / falling down inside my room from the CO2\" (bandcamp).\n",

The song's bridge warns of several disasters, including sea-level rise, and blames humans for it: \"Run and hide there's fire in the sky / Stay inside / The water's gonna rise and pull you under / In your eyes I'm staring at the end of time / Nothing can change us / No one can save us from ourselves\" (Genius Lyrics, audio track). This lyric snippet alone does not conclusively tie the song to climate change, knowing that the album is about a futurist war that occurs when humans lose control of artificial intelligence  (Wikipedia). However, the \"Humanity' music video begins with an image earth in space behind the band, and throughout the video, short video clips of various scenes play, including parched desert earth and an animation of the earth engulfed in flames (YouTube). Furthermore, Scorpions supported the climate activist group Greenpeace during the 2007 tour to support the album, at one point hanging a Greenpeace poster on stage reading \"Stop Deforestation, No Amazon, No Future\" in Portugese (media.greenpeace.org).",

Thom Yorke is a known environmental activist, taking action with groups including 350.org and Friends of the Earth, organizing environmentally conscious concert tours, and appearing at climate-change focused events (Wikipedia). In a 2006 interview with The Chicago Tribune, Yorke described a connection between the album's artwork (a depiction of King Canute attempting to hold back a flood engulfing London) and the writing of environmentalist Jonathan Porritt comparing King Canute's failure to the United Kingdom's response to climate change (Chicago Tribune).",

Lyrics snippet: \"I feel so very sad for all the dead polar bears / We've got to stop making the earth so hot so they can continue to be alive\" (YouTube audio). The long term survival of polar bears is threatened by melting polar ice that they use as habitat, and this is caused by climate change (Global Change Biology).",

Additional lyrics conveying environmental themes, including specific mention of the weather changing over time, are sung by Mykel in the intro: \"Where there's life there is water / We depend on Mama Nature / There's a message for tomorrow / Everything connects to you / Some say soon it will be over / You can see it in the weather / Out of tune with Mama Nature / What you do comes back to you\" (Genius Lyrics).\n",

            "work_title": "WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DYING FOR?",
            "notes": "\"WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DYING FOR?\" by Shawn Mendes is included in the database for strong implicit lyrical references to smoke from the 2023 Canadian wildfires, which formed in conditions exacerbated by climate change (Wikipedia). Furthermore, the song's album art consists entirely of the New York City skyline barely visible through orange smoke from the same wildfires, making the connection extremely clear. The lyrics make multiple references to air quality, including the phrase \"smoke in the air\" and the use of hyperbole in the phrase \"the city's burning down,\" reflecting on just how dystopian the orange sky looks: \"Smoke in the air, the city's burnin' down / I wanna speak, but I don't make a sound / Locked in my mind, you're all I think about (Mm) / I wanna save us, but I don't know how\" (Genius lyrics). In the second verse, Mendes refers to the news (which was full of information about the wildfires at that time) and choking, which both again connect to the air quality emergency: \"I see it in the news, I see it in your eyes, oh / I try to let you go, then I choke, I change my mind / (Change my mind, ooh) / Let's face thе truth, I'm terrified (Ooh, ooh)\" (Genius lyrics). The lyrics reflect multiple narratives at once, including one about a relationship in parallel with the air quality theme, and Mendes confirmed in an interview that the environment (but not climate change specifically) was one inspiration for the song: \"I was upstate New York and just on the back end of feeling a lot of things about relationships, about my career, about the environment. I was in the studio and this moment of just deep frustration came over me and I finally started to feel this inspiration come\" (Billboard). However, the unmistakable connection to the climate change-exacerbated Canadian wildfires through the lyrics and the album art qualify the song for inclusion in the database even without explicit confirmation from the artist that the song is specifically about climate change.",

The song ties together electric vehicles (a low carbon technology), solar energy (a renewable, low carbon energy source), and the need to move past fossil fuels (the source of carbon emissions and thus climate change) through the experiences of individuals living in rural America. The song leans into the idea of sacrificing personal conveniences in order to save the planet, and it goes so far as to compare reliance on fossil fuels (\"black dinosaur juice\") to an addiction. Lyric snippets: \"Well, he traded in his dumb ol' Ford / For a new smart car with an extension cord / Now he’s saving gas and got a cheaper note / But he’s got no way to haul his boat / It’s the little things we take for granted / When we sacrifice to save the planet / Darndest thing I’ve ever seen / That old redneck has done gone green / Down the road, old man McGower / You know he runs his house on the solar power / Now his lights are bright and the music plays / Sorta dark and quiet on the cloudy days ... / The life we knew is coming to a halt / ’S sad but true and it’s our own fault / We put our own crimson necks right in the noose / We got strung out on that black dinosaur juice\" (Genius Lyrics, audio track).",

            "notes": "\"earth moment\" by Sirintip is included in the database for lyrics that construct a personal call to action to specifically address climate change, based on implicit lyrical references and explicit background information about the album \"carbon.\" The opening verse and first chorus reflect on personal responsibility to take action: \"you can tell me i’m lost / that it’s a hopeless cause / you can tell me, there’s no use / that i should move on with my life / but i refuse, to look the other way / i know too much, to turn blind and say / it’s all ok, there’s more we need to do than pray\" (Bandcamp). The song closes with the line \"better use my voice, can't be silent,\" illustrating that Sirintip is using her music for climate activism (Bandcamp). Although climate change is not explicitly referenced in this particular song, the context surrounding the album \"carbon\" clearly illustrates that this personal call to action is about climate change. The album notes for \"carbon\" indicate that the album is inspired by \"three years of climate research and patient self-discovery\" and aims to \"appeal for a new kind of conversation around climate action\" (Bandcamp).",

But if you don't believe this warning / 'Bout the climate and the ozone hole / Look under your tree one Christmas morning / All you'll see are lumps of coal\" (song.risingsea.net). The song was performed live at the Climate Institute's conference in December 1988 in Washington, DC with the Environmental Protection Agency chorus (song.risingsea.net, climate.org archive).

In this context, many uses of the phrase \"climate change\" in the song refer to a change in culture or understanding rather than the scientific meaning. However, \"climate change\" is used in a few specific places that imply double meaning encompassing the scientific meaning as well: \"I feel the flames, known from the climate change, who run it?\" (Genius Lyrics). Flames here could be a reference to Hell in Christianity, or heat and/or wildfires caused by climate change, or perhaps both. Furthermore, GAWVI says \"Climate change not my fault,\" implying an idea of lack of individual responsibility for some bigger phenomenon (Genius Lyrics).",

The song reflects the idea that destruction is coming and that humans are responsible for it: \"We wait / We pray / For the rain / For the rain / For a rain / To wash away / We try / Deny / To believe / To believe / We can't believe / In anything / I don't want to say goodbye / Stars falling from the sky / We will all be judged\nBy what we leave behind\" (Genius Lyrics, audio track).",

Here, Aesop Rock refers to climate change but uses it to represent the change in seasonal weather rather than its definition (changes in weather patterns over long time scales). Aesop rock also uses the word \"climate\" two other times in the song, creating a motif: \"With what I sing, I'll open lash light and dark clash to dim the wattage / Then see the wide-eyed dried raising supplied fiery Colossus / Well, I am a hostage, guiding, yet, pushed beneath the craze's climate / Hiding behind the levy while the stubborn rivers rise and feel this ... I'm a sideline observer alerted not yet retreating / (Close to insanity) / The climate stubbornly hovered slightly above freezing / (Close to insanity) / Now everybody in the populace awaited my reply / (Close to insanity) / I spit a billion tiny brilliant white lights into the sky / (Close to insanity)\" (Genius Lyrics). Weather events, including the rising of a river against a levy, are frequently used as metaphors throughout the song.",

In this context, B.o.B may just be referring to the change in temperature between seasons rather than the change in the climate, but he was particular about using the phrase \"climate change\" in the rhyme, rather than saying \"as the climate changes\" or \"as the weather changes\" or any number of other ways to express a seasonal change in temperature. This specific choice of phrase, accompanied by a momentary drop in the volume of the backing track and B.o.B yelling \"Ha!\" right after \"that's the climate change,\" is almost certainly a recognizable reference to most audiences.",

We must do something about it. In December in Copenhagen, our leaders will have an opportunity to come up with a robust post-climate agreement that is viable and will help make this planet a better place\" (Genius Lyrics). The song ends with a narrated segment by Desmond Tutu: \"I support the Campaign For Climate Justice and I'm pleased to become a climate ally. This is your campaign\" (Genius Lyrics). In addition to the narrated segments, the song refers to warming and agricultural failures and calls the listener to action: \"Down at the river bed / The earth is cracked and dry instead / Farms are failing, cities baking / Steam in 45 degrees / The time has come / To take a stand / It's for the Earth / It's for our land / The time has come / A fact's a fact / The heat is on / No turning back\" (Genius Lyrics).\n",

            "notes": "\"Time For A Change\" by The Jade Assembly is included in the database for context surrounding the song, including confirmation by the band's manager Mick Watson that the song is written about climate change. The song's lyrics include general criticism of government and a call to action to avert a preventable disaster: \"So throw away your brain today and let your government dictate / I’m standing here for everyone who’s never too afraid to say / The time to look ahead is now the time before we’re all dead / Come on / Because it’s time for a change\" (audio track). The song does not make a reference to climate change itself, but the band's manager Mick Watson was quoted in both Express and Metro UK confirming the song's relevance to climate change. In a Metro UK article published on November 11th, 2019, Watson was quoted saying \"The Jade Assembly have always been passionate about the climate crisis and they penned this song out of frustration with the speed and the way our politicians dealt with the crisis\" (metro.co.uk). In an Express article published on November 14th, 2019, Watson was quoted saying \"The song was written about climate change\" (express.co.uk). The music video for the song features footage from protest by climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion (YouTube). It should be noted that information in these articles claim that a campaign to get the song to the No. 1 position in the UK for Christmas in 2019 was a planned collaboration between Extinction Rebellion and The Jade Assembly, but this has been challenged. The official Extinction Rebellion statement released on November 14th, 2019 states that while \"Extinction Rebellion UK would like to thank The Jade Assembly for their support and wish them well in the charts,\" that \"there isn’t an ‘official’ campaign to get an XR ‘anthem’ to number one, as Extinction Rebellion doesn’t ‘team\nup’ or partner in this way\" (Extinction Rebellion).",

            "notes": "\"Golden Chains\" by Hazel Mei is included in the database for context provided by the artist definitely linking the song to climate change. The reveals a bleak outlook on the future of humankind that implies destruction at our own hands. The chorus repeats the lines \"I don't wanna die in golden chains / Crying over loss of golden reigns,\" and other lyrics further tie the song to consumption, wealth, and economic activity: \"But all they do is bury / Our future in their hands / 'Cause all they want is growing / The money they can spend\" (Bandcamp). The song's theme is climate change according to Mei, who wrote \"My climate change anthem \u003c3\" in the description on Bandcamp. The song was nominated for the Environmental Music Prize in 2023, and on the song's entry page, Mei says the following about why she wrote the song: \"The consequences of climate change terrify me. It consumed my mind as I entered adulthood, and I knew I needed to be part of the solution. I read information, watched documentaries, wrote to MPs, attended protests, and reshaped my lifestyle. I was hopeful during the “climate election” of 2019, but felt devastated at the results. It showed me how much work still needed to be done to protect our collective future. My environment-focused echo chamber cast a shadow on the majority, who appeared to prefer short-term economic gain over long-term conservation. I felt helpless for a while before being re-motivated by AURORA and her use of music to inspire and educate. I had previously written songs about important issues but felt too insecure about sharing them. Now, that mindset has changed, inspiring ‘Golden Chains.'\" Keeping with this theme, the music video shows Mei fearfully treading water as it rises above her neck, which may form a reference to sea level rise, a consequence of climate change (YouTube).",

This section notably references the greenhouse effect, carbon emissions, global warming, and the climate activist group Greenpeace. The chorus of the song urges the listener to take action on behalf of the earth: \"I can see quite clearly that the Earth's in distress / We're killing our own planet it's time we all protest / I can see quite clearly that the Earth's in distress / We are all responsible...it's time to show respect\" (Genius lyrics).",

            "notes": "Ministry's \"Alert Level\" is included in the database for a strong implicit reference to climate change. The song contains samples of climate activist Greta Thunberg's speech at the UN Climate Action summit in 2019, which, combined with a pessimistic lyrical message about death and doom and \"the end of the world\" at our own hands, clearly evokes the destruction caused by the climate crisis. Amidst other samples, Greta Thunberg can clearly be heard saying \"Young people are starting to understand your betrayal\" and \"We will not let you get away with this,\" both directly cut from a recording of the 2019 UN speech (Genius lyrics, NPR). The rest of the song's lyrics adhere to a similar tone of anger and condemnation: \"The cards on the table / The hands are on deck / Heading to a future / We all reject / Let's get ready / Let's get ready / Let's get ready / Get ready to die / This is a shame / This is immoral / There's no one to blame / But ourselves\" (Genius Lyrics).",

The song was nominated for the 2023 Environmental Music Prize, and on the song's entry page, the artists' description of the song confirms that the repeated lyric \"the very first year of the apocalypse\" is a reference to the 2020 Australian bush fires (known as the Black Summer of 2020), which were exacerbated by climate change (Environmental Music Prize, Wikipedia). The artists say about the track, \"We were really inspired by the general theme of love and light during darkness – or love during a pandemic and climate crisis\" and the music video includes imagery of a frantic weatherman and small globe burning up in flames, further strengthening the song's tie to the climate. The title of the album this track belongs to is \"One Degree,\" making a clear reference to the amount of global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution (1 degree Celsius) (climate.gov). Merch for the album includes an image of a small thermometer reading 1 degree Celsius, enforcing the reference to the temperature.",

            "notes": "\"Warrior\" by Meraki Mae is included in the database for strong implicit lyrical references to climate change and additional context provided by the artist and contained in the music video. \"The sea's slowly rising and we're slowly dying / Underneath the red hot sun\" forms a clear reference to climate change, specifically warming and sea-level rise, in the context of the song's call to action. The song was chosen as a finalist for the 2023 Environmental Music Prize. On the song's entry web page, Mae describes inspiration for the song coming from the people of Lismore, New South Wales, for climate activism and resilience in the face of disasters including major floods: \"I have watched the way that this vibrant town has been torn apart, and risen in the face of adversity, supporting one another through climate grief, disaster, loss and struggle, to demand change and justice. This passion, this leadership, this deep connection and care, and the hope it represented, is what drove me to write this song ‘Warrior’. It is a song I dedicate to the First Nations voices that drive our fight for a better future, by acknowledging the past. It is a song for us all, to remind us that the earth is our home, to care for and protect. It is a song aimed to empower and to remind us that together, we are capable of great change\" (Environmental Music Prize). The song's music video includes news clips of the Lismore Floods and a fracking protest documentary. According to Mae, \"I wanted the film clip to address the climate catastrophe of the floods but more than that I wanted to show that our community is resilient, strong and will not be ignored, just like we were not ignored at the Bentley Blockade in 2013/14. I wanted to show that it is our ability to love and support each other in the face of adversity that makes us warriors. That together we have the strength to create change\" (Environmental Music Prize).",

The song was a finalist in the 2023 Environmental Music Prize, and on the the song's entry page, the band wrote the following about the music video, tying it explicitly to climate change: \"The concept behind this music video first came about when the lyrics for the single ‘Backburner’ were written. We wanted to work with our videographer on a concept that was thought provoking around climate change and the immediate threat of the Australian bushfires we were facing, and one that also captured the ferocity of our live performance and Axel’s Connection to Country.

Kelly who performs in the music video is a Proud Minjunbal-Yugambeh man with a strong connection to the Gold Coast area... ‘Backburner’ also features powerful words from Indigenous Elder Bruce Shillingsworth from ABC’s Q\u0026A program in October 2019 when he called for Australia to “wake up”\" (Environmental Music Prize).\n",

            "notes": "\"Moral Panic\" by Nothing But Thieves is included in the database for a strong implicit lyrical reference to climate change and for additional context provided by the artist in interviews linking the song to climate change. The song's opening verse likely paraphrases from a 2019 speech given to European Parliament by youth climate activist Greta Thunberg. In the speech, which was given on April 16th, 2019 in front of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, Thunberg urged political leaders to take action on climate change, saying \"Well, our house is falling apart, and we are rapidly running out of time. And yet, basically nothing is happening. Everyone and everything needs to change\" (Archives of Women's Political Communication). The song appears to quote one of the lines from this speech and refer to Thunberg: \"This is the last day of my life, yours too / Haven't you ever seen the ocean look so blue? / \"And now we're running out of time\", she said / All of the children are so anxious, they're on edge / Yeah, it's tense, so tense\" (Genius Lyrics). Furthermore, the lyrics use imagery of burning to describe what is happening to the earth, further developing the theme around climate change by possibly alluding to forest fires or high temperatures and emphasizing that humanity is complicit in the destruction: \"Now, the earth, it turns so slow / Strike up a match and we let it go / Now, the earth, it burns so slow / A million faces in a row / We're standing back and we watch it go / And we let it go / And we let it go / And we let it\" (Genius Lyrics). In an interview with Maria Bocci for music critic website The Line of Best Fit, lead guitarist and vocalist confirmed the song's connection to climate change, saying \"It’s kind of this pessimistic, dark, Simon and Garfunkel song about the end of the world and about climate change which has this infectious kind of dance groove to it, but it’s quite sad and emotionally sung I think\" (The Line of Best Fit).",

            "notes": "\"Won't Give Up\" by Pattie Gonie featuring Yo-Yo Ma and Quinn Christopherson is included in the database for context surrounding the song, including confirmation by the artists that it was written as an anthem for climate change activism. The song's music video was filmed near Exit Glacier glacier in Kenai Fjords National Park, which shows the glacier before and after significant melting due to climate change (NPR). \"There's a lot of potential for this song to be sung at climate rallies, to be sung as a part of the climate movement,\" said Gonia, as quoted in an NPR article about the song published on November 13th, 2023 (NPR). While the lyrics do not refer to climate change in explicit terms, they offer a call to action in the midst of a great challenge (\"I won't give up for a minute / Never giving up on you\"), an appeal to unity (\"You \u0026 I / Made up of the same things / Nature running in our veins\"), and a couple of potential global warming references: \"Well we’re caught / Caught up in the fire of time ... I saw you burning / Up in the night\" (YouTube). Gonia acknowledges that the song is intentionally vague and may relate to people fighting for other causes, such as LGBTQ+ right, saying \"If a person hears it and thinks that it's not about climate but that it's about racial justice or that it's about queer rights, that's beautiful. Take it, go for it\" (NPR).",

The song's reflective lyrics imagine life 10,000 years ago before human activity affected the natural world and implore the listener to be \"a bit more Gentle\" to mother earth. In the second verse, Mae directly mentions ice melting, loss of ocean biodiversity, and deforestation: \"Grew up thinking how much I  / Can’t wait to see the coral reefs, And the Amazon, and the glaciers and a million more. / But now that’s turning into a pipe dream, How can it be, it’s not that we can’t see, So why we doing nothing?\" (YouTube video description). \"Gentle\" was nominated for the 2023 Environmental Music Prize. In her own words: \"Writing this song was therapy! I’d been wanting to express my anxiety about the impacts of climate change on mother earth for so long, but could never really find the right words to put in a pop song\" (Environmental Music Prize).\n",

This alone does not tie the song to climate change specifically, but the lyrics refer to a world that has warmed enough to affect agriculture and prevent Kenya and Colombia from being able to grow coffee: \"To the next generation, merry Christmas / You're working harder than ever now and the coffee sucks / You know Colombia and Kenya got too damn hot / And now you're making do with what you've got\" (Genius Lyrics). Beyond this clear reference to global warming, the lyrics also refer to storm surge and storm frequency, both associated with climate change: \"Killer waves and riots / Coming to the coastline soon / Counting up the new typhoons / Quicker than kilowatts / How could you deny it?\" (Genius Lyrics). The song was discussed in the podcast \"Degrees,\" season 3, episode 1, \"Lake Street Dive on music, activism, and bravery\" (Spotify).",

The song's lyrics lament the disappearance of many species, using imagery of a dry, barren desert: \"The hourglass drains there’s no Noah’s Ark in the desert / So they’re going away / Only time rains down on this bleak parade in the desert / The Twilight of Wilder Days\" (YouTube). The song was a finalist for the 2023 Environmental Music Prize, and on the song's web page, Anastasia ties the song's inspiration to climate change: \"In Losing Wild, I explore how the loss of biodiversity diminishes human imagination. The song suggests that the extinction crisis not only poses heartbreaking and planet-threatening external risks, but also heralds the end of good poetry and diminishment of playful minds. We need to listen to our scientists, and to find solutions we also all need to engage our imaginations. We are already feeling the effects of anthropogenic climate change. We know now that without decisive, urgent and widespread changes there are frightening climate tipping points on our horizon that could trigger cascades of further catastrophic effects. To turn things around we need to spark social tipping points mobilising a population to demand systemic change. To do this I believe we need the full engagement and commitment of creative minds, and our artistic community\" (Environmental Music Prize).",

While this verse does not explicitly mention global warming, it contains enough context to be directly linked to Inside Climate News reporting in 2015 documenting oil company Exxon Mobil's internal knowledge of the warming effect of greenhouse gas emissions in internal reports and presentations from 1982 (Inside Climate News). Exxon would later dedicate resources to promoting climate change skepticism (to \"Emphasize the uncertainty\" in climate models) despite its internal knowledge of the relationship between emissions and warming (Assessing ExxonMobil's climate change communications).",

The song's chorus begs the listener to protect \"la maison,\" which is French for \"the home,\" a clear reference to the Earth: \"Save my home in the jungle / Save my home in the polar / (La, maison la-la-la, maison) / Save my home in the ocean / Save my home in the desert / (La, maison) / Please, someone fight for us\" (Genius lyrics).

Furthermore, songwriter Stu Mackenzie confirmed the song's connection to climate change. In the first verse, three lines connected to climate change are grouped together: \"When the ocean's coming up / When the rain just won't stop / When the fire's burning / If not now, then when?\" (Genius Lyrics). While not naming climate change explicitly, this verse makes very clear references to the issues of sea level rise, changing rainfall patterns, and increased wildfires, all of which are consequences of climate change. \"If Not Now, Then When?\" was a 2022 finalist for the Environmental Music Prize, and songwriter Stu Mackenzie wrote the following on the entry's webpage: \"I’ve written quite a few songs about climate change, but after the black summer bushfires in 2019-2020, shit started to feel dire. It still feels dire – more dire. We need actual, real, tangible action from our leaders, otherwise what are they there for? Why are we not doing everything we humanly can to right our wrongs? When we’re literally on fire, why not now? If not now, then when?\" (environmentalmusicprize.com).",

This song was performed by Lauren Lopez and the original cast. The musical follows a tribe of prehistoric humans as they discover and react to fire for the first time, and the song \"climate change\" illustrates how the humans have changed their lifestyle using this new tool to eat animals instead of hunting and gathering: \"Huh, that's right, just do whatever you want / There's been a change in the climate / Something's in the air / I feel the heat / No need to define it (need to define it) / We don't really care (Ahh...) / Come on, let's eat now / There's more food than we can eat in a lifetime / No need to share / No, baby, it's all mine\" (Genius Lyrics). The reference to global warming is made very clear in a joke delivered to the audience, breaking the fourth wall, by the character Zazzalil, who says \"I believe that if we burn enough things, we can change the climate permanently\" (YouTube). In this context, the song makes a comparison between the technological development of fire in prehistoric times and the consumption of fossil fuels in modern times. ",

The rate the world's sea level is rising suggests that it may lead to a rapid change which would create momentous problems for citizens that live in coastal regions. This has led scientists to describe these days as the Anthropocene - the new geological era constructed by humans. The recent unparalleled temperatures in the Arctic as well as the data showing abnormal rises in upper atmospheric methane levels converge to give the impression that the near future of the entire human race is at stake\" (Genius Lyrics).

You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you! For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you're doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight. You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that. Because if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil. And that I refuse to believe\" (NPR). ",

In an interview with KMUW Wichita in 2021, Tate directly ties the meaning of the song to climate change: \"“Resistance” is about the climate change debate and the results of climate change, what it’s been doing to the civilized world\" (kmuw.org). The song's lyrics, given this context, take on a more specific meaning: \"Burning coal / Got to keep the company warm as / The rain keeps killing the trees / Cut 'em down quick / Pay the man his wage, he's making paper / To fuel the \"Information Age\" / Out in the midwest / Hear the roar of the plough / Turning grassland into sand / Got to feed the people more every day / But the wind keeps blowing the land away\" (Genius Lyrics). This verse identifies three major causes of climate change, namely the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, deforestation, and industrial agriculture. The song emphasizes acts of resistance against this environmental destruction: \"Protests in New York / Listen to the call of the wild / Brother, sisters carrying signs/ Breathe deep before it's too late\" (Genius Lyrics).

On the Apple Music album description, Kidjo explicitly ties the album as a whole to climate change: “When I became pregnant, it was obvious to ask myself the question: What kind of world are we going to leave to our children and beyond?” she tells Apple Music. “And it became more and more relevant as I started seeing the proof of climate change—let me start writing a love letter to Mother Earth, Mother Nature\" (Apple Music). This thematic tie to climate change highlights a lyrical reference to rising sea levels and coastal damage: \"Don't ever let 'em hurt you in any way / Oh never let them steal and take the best of you / Keep building cities from the ground / We're rising with the waves\" (Genius Lyrics). Furthermore, her description of suddenly noticing proof of climate changes gives significance to Mother Nature's \"warning\" and a \"time bomb\" in the lyrics, possibly representing the limited amount of time left to address climate change: \"Mother Nature has a way of warning us / A time bomb set on a lost countdown / Do you hear it? Will you stop it? / Won't you listen?\" (Genius Lyrics).\n",

The song's stance on global warming is unclear, as is the connection to the Chemtrails conspiracy, but one possible explanation for the reference is the erroneous belief that condensation trails left by aircraft constitute attempts at chemical geoengineering to reverse the effects of global warming or otherwise manipulate the weather (Wikipedia). While the song is mainly supporting an erroneous, conspiratorial belief, the lyrics notably tie the phenomenon of global warming to carbon dioxide emissions, a relationship that is well grounded in scientific evidence (climate.gov).",

The song describes a group of island people adapting to sea level rise by adopting new ideas about collaboration and leaving old structures (both physical and conceptual) behind. The sea level rise is clearly the result of climate change in the context of the song based on references to melting ice caps and to global warming specifically. Lyric snippet: \"That which creates life has power to take it right back / Fucking with the ice caps / We've gotta push the tide back / We can survive collapse / If we don't get sidetracked ... We float on tsunami to global warming / We need structures to control what's coming / Corporate monopolies obsolete / That philosophy leaves us lost at sea / But from Marwar to Cochabamba / We are the warriors that won't get conquered / Cause rising tides drown all villages / Divided fighters succumb to pillage\" (Genius Lyrics).",

The title of the song and the chorus refer to the warming of the oceans, which is a clear consequence of global warming. Furthermore, the song's second verse makes additional references to changes in weather: \"Grayin' with the gatherin' storm and the smoke hangs on the breeze / I know that I got you and you know that you got me\" (Genius Lyrics). While indirect, these allusions to weather, taken together, clearly call to mind global warming and two direct consequences of it: increased intensity of storms and wildfire smoke. The chorus emphasizes the gravity of climate change and the desire to run away from it with a loved one, mentioning \"the world's weight upon us:\" \"Said the sea gets hotter / And the drums beat louder / And world seems colder / Singing that same old tune / And the times get harder / World's weight upon us / But it don't mean nothin' / Cause we're leavin' soon\" (Genius Lyrics).\n",

The lyrics describe enormous deadly tornadoes and the destruction and death they cause, which is linked in multiple songs and the narrative arc of the album to the worship of the \"Motor Spirit,\" a deity associated with fossil fuels and the internal combustion engine. \"Supercell\" connects the power of the destructive tornadoes directly to the wrath of the Motor Spirit: \"24 dead in my state/ Motor spirit subjugate / Creator, a burning mouth / Carnage North, East, West, and South / EF5, force of nature / Demolition, meet your maker / Throwing cities like leaves / Our mortal surface is wiped clean\" (Genius lyrics). \"EF5\" is a tornado classification, and the statistic \"24 dead in my state\" may refer to deaths in the state of Mississippi during early 2023 due to tornadoes (NOAA). It is important to note that the links between climate change and tornado intensity and frequency are not firmly established (NOAA fact sheet). Despite this uncertainty, the subtext of climate change as an unnamed link between the Motor Spirit and environmental destruction is present throughout lyrics in this song and the entire album concept.",

The chorus of the song uses the phrase \"I need someone to show me\" following a statement that the subject is skeptical or critical of, and the second example of this includes a reaction to climate denial: \"They telling me global warming's a fantasy but (I need someone to show me)\" (Genius Lyrics). Later in the song, Chali 2na ties global warming to oil production and foreign policy: \"Foreign soil occupation for oil confiscation / Politicians make the climate hot as satan\" (Genius Lyrics). ",

            "notes": "Fredrika Stahl's song \"Tomorrow,\" written for the 2015 French documentary of the same name, is included in the database for implicit lyrical references to climate change and the subject material of the film it was written for. The lyrics refer to a future environmental crisis that can be resolved based on actions taken today, with one direct reference to \"facing a storm\" (Genius lyrics). Lyric snippets: \"It's always so hard to see / How things could turn out differently / But we're in a mess now / I feel it we're facing a wall / Fight it out wipe out the wrong / Fight for us we must go on / The whole world is on hold now / I feel it we're facing a storm / See the final show now / Face the final blow now / Start looking around you will get it all the omens all the signs / Believe we can change for the better make some good things down the line / For tomorrow we'll reap what we sow today tomorrow will be if we change\" (Genius lyrics). While the indirect lyrics could easily be applied to climate change, the lyric video for the song published by Stahl's label (Cristal Records) is more explicit in its imagery, depicting many scenes of low-carbon technologies (solar panels and wind farms) and video footage of fossil fuel extraction and pollution from power plants (youtube). Finally, the documentary explicitly covers energy solutions to climate change and was played at COP 21, tying the song definitively to climate change through this additional context (Wikipedia).",

English actor Doug Bradley provides narration for the introduction of the song that specifically mentions biodiversity loss due to climate change: \"The ability to sustain life on earth is shrinking in perfect unison with rising population. Soon, half of all species will be lost to climate change and ecological collapse due to human activity. Thus we either reduce our race voluntarily or nature will do it for us. And she will be fucking brutal\" (Genius Lyrics). The remainder of the song follows this theme of mutual destruction, naming several causes and effects of climate change, including \"naive consumption,\" \"acidifying seas,\" \"mass extinction,\" and \"Jungles culled, sold on or cindered\" (Genius Lyrics).",

The lyrics connect this destruction to the worship of the Motor Spirit, continuing the album's allusion to climate change: \"I am removed, I am a cloud / In peering down, I am endowed / Motor spirit, that brought me here / Fly to the moon, I have no fear / The twisters worm as tyres burn / The screeching rims, Gale force winds / The judgement day, murder tycoon / Ground control from the bird's eye view\" (Genius lyrics). The line \"Motor spirit, that brought be here\" could literally refer to the fossil fuel that powered a rocket to space to escape the deadly storms, or it could figuratively establish the causality between worshipping the Motor Spirit and the storms, and idea firmly developed in the previous two tracks.",

The first track on the album \"Petrodragonic Apocalypse,\" the song sets up the world in which the album's story takes place, a barren, fiery desert full of highways in which mankind consumes fossil fuels and worships a deity called the \"Motor Spirit.\" The practice of worshipping the Motor Spirit and consuming fossil fuels has all sorts of ill effects on humanity, from death and illness (\"Highway death by Motor Spirit,\" \"Bloody stool,\" \"Fire pious side effects\") to weather disasters: \"Dire fate shall plague our land / Hurricanes shall sweepeth sand / The winds doth howl and moaneth / Homes and lives overthrowneth\" (Genius lyrics). The lyrics clearly place the blame on humanity for worshipping the Motor Spirit and bringing about these harms, with the narrator begging for forgiveness: \"Engine Gaia, piston wheeze / The messiah on their knees / Beg the wind, beg the tree / Beg the bug for mercy / Motor spirit, dragon race / Burning cars, outer space / Petrol king, abdicate / Human-kind, exonerate\" (Genius lyrics). The relationship between the consumption and worship of fossil fuels and a destructive change in weather patterns creates an unnamed but powerful allusion to climate change that continues to be developed in other songs on the album, including \"Supercell.\" The relationship between the album as a whole and climate change was noted by music critics including NPR music contributor Matthew Perpetua in his review of \"Petrodragonic Apocalypse\" (npr.org).",

            "notes": "Mo'Ju's \"Change Has To Come,\" an invigorating and funky call to action, is included in the database for strong implicit references to climate change in both the lyrics and the song's music video. The lyrics do not mention global warming or climate change by name, but they highlight warning signs of a future storm in the context of calling for action: \"Can’t you hear the bell signal the warning? / Here comes the storm / Best we be gone\" (Lyrics in YouTube Description). Furthermore, the lyrics frequently create a motif of motion upwards, through the words \"rising\" and \"elevate\" in the chorus, while in parallel the music video depicts Mo'Ju and their band performing as water rises slowly rises to their heads, creating a clear visual reference to flooding or sea level rise. The song was nominated for the 2023 Environmental Music Prize, and on the song's entry page, Mo'Ju links the music video specifically to Australian bush fires and flooding, both of which are exacerbated by climate change: \"When I first started writing this song we were experiencing bushfires all over the country. By the time I made the video in 2022, we were experiencing unprecedented flooding around the country. I wanted to make something simple that evoked both fire and flood and spoke to the urgency of the situation. So you will see tonally the colour palette is of burnt orange and reds, but as the video progresses there is water rising around us, which eventually reaches our necks. There is also a sun setting behind us, a metaphor for time running out and the sun setting on our life as we know it, if we continue to let the waters rise\" (Environmental Music Prize). \n",

            "notes": "Grimes and i_o's song \"Violence\" is included in the database for the context of Grimes' description of the album's themes related to climate change and elements of the music video. The lyrics depict a lover singing to a partner about how they both allow and depend on violence inflicted on the subject: \"I'm, like, begging for it, baby / Makes you wanna party, wanna wake up / Baby, it's violence, violence / Baby, it's violence / But you can't see what I see / You can't see what I see / 'Cause you, ha, ha, you feed off hurting me / Off hurting me, yeah, ha-ha\" (Genius lyrics). Alone, the lyrics do not make a reference to climate change, but when taken in the context of Grimes' description of the album's themes, it is easy to envision song's subject as the earth. Grimes posted a description of the album in 2019 on her Instagram: \"It’s called Miss_Anthropocene. It’s a concept album about the anthropomorphic Goddess of climate Change: A psychedelic, space-dwelling demon/ beauty-Queen who relishes the end of the world. She’s composed of Ivory and Oil. Each song will be a different embodiment of human extinction as depicted through a Pop star Demonology\" (NME). The music video for \"Violence\" ends with an image of a fairy figure plunging a sword through a bleeding earth, similar to the image used in some versions of the album's cover art, enforcing the idea that the Goddess of climate change is the perpetrator of the violence discussed in the song (YouTube).",

Droughts are intensifying. Our oceans are acidifying. Methane levels rising up in the ocean floor... We are seeing extreme weather events. The west Antarctic ice shifts melting at unprecedented rate.

The lyrics are vague and do not reference climate change directly, but the chorus lyrics could conceivably be interpreted to represent climate denial (not confirmed): \"It's a beautiful lie / It's a perfect denial / Such a beautiful lie to believe in / So beautiful, beautiful it makes me\" (Genius Lyrics, audio track).\n",

For example, Florida, known for its warm, beach-friendly weather year-round, would be considered unusually hot at 99 degrees Farhenheit in October (tripsavvy.com). In the context of the song's lyrical themes, the unusually high temperatures in the Fall and Winter are signifying that Summer, representing the warmth of a romance, is not over yet, at least according to the hopes of the song's narrator: \"99 in October / This summer's far from over / Why don't you even come over? / Before too long we'll be older / And it'll be colder / We'll be looking back over our shoulder/ 88 in December / Our love's now a glowing ember\" (Spotify).",

The song, clearly directed at the recently inaugurated 45th United States President Donald Trump, criticizes his skepticism and denial of climate change: \"And I heard you say climate change isn't real / But that's not how the world's leading scientists feel / So go bury your head in the sand if you will / But the waters are rising around Capitol Hill\" (Genius Lyrics). Trump's statements on climate change over the years have varied greatly in meaning but have often referred to it as a hoax, according to a Washington Post article published only months before Trump's inauguration and the release of this song (Washington Post).",

In this context, the lyrics in \"Atlantic\" clearly refer to climate change as a dark thought that is difficult to face head-on: \"Thinking I should get all this dying off of my mind / I should really know better than to read the headlines / Does it matter if I see it? / No really, can I not just cover my eyes?\" (Genius Lyrics).",

This track mostly consists of a spoken narration about climate change, and it is placed before the final song on the regular release of the album \"Death Atlas\" (Wikipedia). Jon Fishman, the drummer of the jam band Phish, performed the narration, which includes the following: \"The recent unparalleled temperatures in the arctic, as well as the data showing abnormal rises in upper atmosphere methane levels, converge to give the impression that the near future of the entire human race is at stake. In 2018 the World Bank Group reported that many countries will need to prepare for over 100-million displaced people, as well as the displacement of millions of international refugees due to the ill effects of climate change. It has become clear that an enormous operation and policy program to revolutionize agriculture and repair the Earth's ecosystems is immediately needed\" (Wikipedia, Genius Lyrics). ",

When considered with a generational shift in attitudes on an environmental crisis (\"But the children seem to be getting alarmed / Don't worry kids, it's nothing at all / When I hear about the doom and gloom / That's around the corner and coming soon / I take a sip of mother's ruin / And sit with my back to the wall\"), as well a reference to the destructive power of Mother Nature in the form of winds (\"And she blew all the leaves off my tree\"), the song clearly references climate change denial (Genius Lyrics, audio track). The music video illustrates the denial with a man in a top hat and purple suit strutting about and claiming nothing is wrong while a trail of plastic pollution attaches itself to his suit and weighs him down, ultimately dragging him to the ground as he continues to sing \"It's nothing at all\" (Genius Lyrics, YouTube, audio track).",

In the first verse, \"having babies\" and \"eating meat\" are referred to as activities contributing to \"collateral damage:\" \"Collateral damage, crowd control / Not sure who paid, not sure who stole / Somebody always pays when you get it on the cheap / So I stopped having babies and I stopped eating meat\" (Genius Lyrics). In terms of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming, having one fewer child and adopting a vegetarian diet are both considered significant for individuals looking to reduce personal carbon footprint (Environmental Research Letters). Both of these specific lifestyle changes, considered together, clearly form an implicit reference to greenhouse gas emissions, indicating that the \"collateral damage,\" at least in this verse, is climate change. Additionally, in this context, the lyric \"Not sure who paid, not sure who stole\" may refer to the difficulties in accounting for who is responsible for greenhouse gases and the lyric \"Somebody always pays when you get it on the cheap\" may indicate that global warming is the cost of the consumption of cheap fossil fuels, but these last two references are less clear-cut and thus unconfirmed.",

Newman confirmed in an interview with Rolling Stone in 2012 that the song is a reaction the the Republican party, which has a history of climate change denial and climate change skepticism (Rolling Stone).\n",

Given the group's habit of specifically referencing climate change in later songs (Kyoto Now!, Changing Tide), and the incredibly specific attention paid to other environmental issues like the hole in the ozone layer in their 1990 song Unacceptable, the lyric \"Temperature is rising\" almost certainly references global warming, a topic already part of mainstream political discourse by 1993 (Genius lyrics).

The opening lyrics describe inescapable rising water levels, at one point implying temperature rise with the phrase \"boiling over:\" \"Try to build a wall that is high enough / It's all boiling over, all boiling over / Mmm, mmm / Try to save your house, try to save your songs / Try to run but it follows you up the hill / It's all boiling over, all boiling over\" (Genius Lyrics, audio track). Thom Yorke is a known environmental activist, taking action with groups including 350.org and Friends of the Earth, organizing environmentally conscious concert tours, and appearing at climate-change focused events. In a 2006 interview with The Chicago Tribune, Yorke described a connection between the album's artwork (a depiction of King Canute attempting to hold back a flood engulfing London) and the writing of environmentalist Jonathan Porritt comparing King Canute's failure to the United Kingdom's response to climate change.

In the second verse, Cockburn mentions global warming as part of two lines that express temperature contrast: \"In the age of global warming / When all things are growing colder\" (Genius Lyrics). Although the reference is unconfirmed, the first verse of the song mentions sailors trying to plug holes in a ship that is on fire, which could be a metaphor for ineffective interventions to prevent climate change: \"They're trying to plug holes in the hull / While flames eat up the deck / The captain and his crew / Don't seem to get the disconnect\" (Genius Lyrics).

The song focuses on the contrast between temperatures throughout, following Buffet's typical pattern of singing about drinking and having a good time on the beach: \"So turn up the heat and chill the rosé / Take off your Ugg's and let your metatarsals play / Even though the South of France is 10,000 miles away / We can turn up the heat and chill the rosé\" (Genius Lyrics). The global warming reference appears at the end of the song and appears to be included to reinforce the temperature contrast motif: \"So turn up the heat and chill the rosé / Stretch out on the beach and let your metatarsals play / Even though the ocean's frozen and there's mountains of sorbet / We'll survive this global warming if you chill the rosé\" (Genius Lyrics).",

Grimes' full description of the album in the now-deleted instagram post was reported as follows in the NME article cited by Wikipedia: \"It’s called Miss_Anthropocene. It’s a concept album about the anthropomorphic Goddess of climate Change: A psychedelic, space-dwelling demon/ beauty-Queen who relishes the end of the world. She’s composed of Ivory and Oil. Each song will be a different embodiment of human extinction as depicted through a Pop star Demonology. The first song ‘we appreciate power’, introduced the pro-AI-propaganda girl group who embody our potential enslavement/destruction at the hands of Artificial General intelligence\" (NME). The digital-only version of the album art that was used for the album starting in December of 2020 depicts an elf figure with mechanical wings and tattoos holding a sword that is plunged through a bleeding earth (Wikipedia).",

            "notes": "Folk music is a music genre that includes traditional folk music and the contemporary genre that evolved from the former during the 20th-century folk revival. Some types of folk music may be called world music. Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, music that is played on traditional instruments, music about cultural or national identity, music that changes between generations (folk process), music associated with a people's folklore, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. The term originated in the 19th century, but folk music extends beyond that. Starting in the mid-20th century, a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music. This process and period is called the (second) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s. This form of music is sometimes called contemporary folk music or folk revival music to distinguish it from earlier folk forms. Smaller, similar revivals have occurred elsewhere in the world at other times, but the term folk music has typically not been applied to the new music created during those revivals. This type of folk music also includes fusion genres such as folk rock, folk metal, and others. While contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music, in U.S. English it shares the same name, and it often shares the same performers and venues as traditional folk music.",

As the climate continues to change, many historically wet areas are likely to experience increased precipitation... and increased risk of flooding..., while historically dry areas are likely to experience less precipitation and increased risk of drought. As a result, since the 1950s, some regions of the world have experienced longer and more intense droughts, particularly in southern Europe and West Africa, while other regions have seen droughts become less frequent, less intense, or shorter (for example, in central North America) (EPA).",

Biodiversity, or biological diversity, is a term that refers to the number of genes, species, individual organisms within a given species, and biological communities within a defined geographic area, ranging from the smallest ecosystem to the global biosphere. (A biological community is an interacting group of various species in a common location.) Likewise, biodiversity loss describes the decline in the number, genetic variability, and variety of species, and the biological communities in a given area. This loss in the variety of life can lead to a breakdown in the functioning of the ecosystem where decline has happened. Climate change has been identified as a major cause of biodiversity loss (Encyclopedia Brittanica).",

            "notes": "In the 200-plus years since the industrial revolution began, the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has increased due to human actions. During this time, the pH of surface ocean waters has fallen by 0.1 pH units. This might not sound like much, but the pH scale is logarithmic, so this change represents approximately a 30 percent increase in acidity. Ocean acidification is already impacting many ocean species, especially organisms like oysters and corals that make hard shells and skeletons by combining calcium and carbonate from seawater (NOAA).",
